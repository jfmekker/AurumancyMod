# AurumancyMod

A Forge compatible Minecraft mod that adds a simple magic system. It is designed to "feel" like vanilla with some extra magic mechanics, that should fit in with the enchantment table mechanical theme while being a little for involved. Experience points act as "mana" and gold can be spent to gain some.

### Versions

Forge 31.2.0 / Minecraft 1.15.2 / Aurumancy 1.0

## Mechanics

The two primary mechanics are Magic Items and Rituals.

Rituals require you to create a Ritual Circle empowered by pillars of different materials. It consumes items and some mana (experience points) and produces some effect. This is how must Magic Items will be created in-game.

Magic items all have unique effects and each have their own point cost.
