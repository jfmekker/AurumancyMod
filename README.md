# AurumancyMod

A Forge compatible Minecraft mod that adds a simple magic system. It is designed to "feel" like vanilla with some extra magic mechanics, that should fit in with the enchantment table mechanical theme. Experience points act as "mana" and gold can be spent to gain some.

### Versions

Forge 31.2.0 / Minecraft 1.15.2 / Aurumancy 0.0.1

## Mechanics

The two primary mechanics are Wands and Rituals.

Rituals require you to arrange blocks in a certain way and activate it with a Ritual Wand. It consumes the blocks and some mana (experience points) and produces some effect. This is how must Wands will be created in-game.

Wands all have unique effects and each have their own point cost.
